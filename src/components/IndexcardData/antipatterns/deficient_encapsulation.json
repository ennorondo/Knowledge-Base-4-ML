            "description": "This smell occurs when the declared accessibility of one or more members of an abstraction is more permissive than actually required. For example, a class that makes its fields public suffers from Deficient Encapsulation. If the client is able to get information about the implementation, one would rather call it Leaky Encapsulation.",
