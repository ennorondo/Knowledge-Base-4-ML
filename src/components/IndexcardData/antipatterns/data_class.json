      "description": "A service/class that exclusively performs information retrieval and typically provides only simple read operations. Often goes hand in hand with Feature Envy, because relevant functionality is not provided.",
      "context": "",
      "detection": "The service only contains accessor operations, i.e. getters and setters, and usually deals with very small messages with primitive data types.",
      "consequences": "A data service may have a large number of operations with low cohesion, which can have a negative influence on maintainability.",
      "cause": "It's a normal thing when a newly created class contains only a few public fields (and maybe even a handful of getters/setters). But the true power of objects is that they can contain behavior types or operations on their data.",
