      "description": "A high number of operations is required to complete one abstraction. Such operations are typically attribute-level setters and getters or part of a CRUDy Interface.",
      "context": "",
      "detection": "A chatty service may have many fine-grained operations.",
      "consequences": "Maintenance becomes harder, like e.g. changing the order of invocations. Many interactions are required, which leads to overall higher response time. This can be especially harmful when synchronous requests are chained together.",

      "solution": "Simple operations should not be exposed via interfaces. Instead, a more coarse-grained operation should be created to fulfill an abstraction.",
