            "description": "Data and behavior that acts on that data belong together. When a method makes too many calls to other classes to obtain data or functionality, Feature Envy is in the air. It is often, but not always, accompanied by another code smell, Data Classes",
            "context": "Sometimes behavior is purposefully kept separate from the class that holds the data. The usual advantage of this is the ability to dynamically change the behavior (see Strategy, Visitor and other patterns).",

            "consequences": "",
            "cause": "This smell may occur after fields are moved to a data class. If this is the case, you may want to move the operations on data to this class as well.",
            "solution": "As a basic rule, if things change at the same time, you should keep them in the same place. Usually data and functions that use this data are changed together (although exceptions are possible). Extract Method; Move Method",
