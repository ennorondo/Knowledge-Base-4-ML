      "description": "Business processes have been strictly defined and are now static and cannot be easily changed.",
      "context": "Especially in small and medium sized businesses, business processes are often not stable. Moreover, not enough data of good quality may be available to allow a solid design.",
      "detection": "",
      "consequences": "Business process owners have little to no control over the outcome and quality of their processes, since they cannot change their structure. They are merely observers.",
      "cause": "Business processes have been rigorously defined in the past and are now regarded as stable by technical experts. Therefore, business owners may not be able to easily commission for changes.",
      "solution": "End-users have to be involved in the business processes and therefore, user-oriented interfaces have to be created. In Microservices, cross-functional teams ensure a holistic view on services and their functionality.",
